# StudentAPI

## Overview

The Student API is a Java-based Spring Boot application designed to manage student information. It provides endpoints to add, retrieve, update, and delete student records, including details such as name, email, and department. This API is useful for educational institutions, allowing them to keep track of their students information efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher:** The project is developed using Java, so you need a compatible JDK installed on your machine. Here I used JDK 17.

- **IntelliJ IDEA (or any preferred IDE):** You can use any Java IDE, but IntelliJ IDEA is recommended for a smooth development experience.

- **Postman:** This tool will help you test the API endpoints and verify their functionality.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Student API, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   git clone https://github.com/RachamallaYeswanthReddy/StudentAPI.git

2. **Open the Project in IntelliJ IDEA:**

   - Open IntelliJ IDEA.
   - Click on "File" -> "Open" and select the project folder.

## Configuration

The project's configuration can be found in the 'application.properties' file. You can adjust database settings, server ports, and other configuration options as needed.

## Running the Application

You have two options for running the Student API:

### Using IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.

2. Locate the 'IntroApplication' class in the project structure.

3. Right-click on 'IntroApplication' and select "Run 'IntroApplication'".

### Using Command Line:

1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

2. Run the following command:

   ./mvnw spring-boot:run

The application will start, and you will see log messages indicating that the server is up and running.

## Testing the API ( Recommended)

To test the Student API, you can use Postman or any similar API testing tool:

1. Open Postman.

2. Create a new request and set the request type (e.g., POST, GET , DELETE, PUT  ).

3. Enter the URL for the desired API endpoint (e.g., http://localhost:8011/api/v1/student/delete/12  , http://localhost:8011/api/v1/student/update/1 ).

4. Add any required headers, request parameters, or request body data according to the API documentation.

5. Click the "Send" button to make the request and view the API's response.
